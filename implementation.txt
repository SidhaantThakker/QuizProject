Topic: Quizzing Web App

Use: This app is intended for use as a game. It simulates a question answer session between a quizmaster and participant.

Languages Used:  HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Implementation:
1. Each question along with its associated options, correct answer, and some metadata will be stored as 
an object in an array stored in the local storage for now using JSON.
2. At the end, the final score will be displayed.

Optional Features (if time permits):
1. A global highscore board that stores a user-entered nickname and their score
2. Storing the answers in a back end script to prevent cheating

Future Updates: 

1. Ability to use the app as a template to make your own quizzes, and the interface to make it possible.
2. Ability to submit your own quiz questions to add to the global pool.
